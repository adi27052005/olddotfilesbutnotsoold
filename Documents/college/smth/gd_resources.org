Good Afternoon Everyone, I am Aditya Gautam. This is group number 24 and the topic for today's group dicussion is "Chip Shortage: The Global Technology Crisis". We are gathered here today to discuss a crisis that has sent shockwaves through the global technology landscape, impacting industries, economies, and daily life as we know it. The chip shortage, also known as the semiconductor shortage, refers to a global crisis characterized by a shortage of microchips and other semiconductor components used in a wide range of electronic devices, from smartphones and laptops to automobiles and medical equipment. Take my own experience, for instance. I wanted to purchase a Raspberry Pi—a versatile mini-computer—about a year ago. However, I encountered a dual challenge. Not only was it hard to find one, but when I did, the prices had skyrocketed due to the chip shortage. 3rd party sellers were capitalizing on the situation, abusing the shortage to sell these devices at exorbitant prices. This personal encounter underscores the widespread nature of this crisis. It's not just about tech giants; it's about individuals, small businesses, and entire industries grappling with supply chain disruptions, increased prices, and the challenges posed by opportunistic sellers. Join us today as we unravel the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to this global technology crisis, one that hits close to home for many. Let's explore how the chip shortage is reshaping our tech-driven world.

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Aditya Gautam, representing Group 24. Our topic today: 'Chip Shortage: The Global Technology Crisis.'
