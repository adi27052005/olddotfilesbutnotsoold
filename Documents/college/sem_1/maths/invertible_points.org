* Invertible Matrices
Let A be a n x n square matrix
** A is an invertible matrix
** Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution
** The equation Ax = b has atleast one unique solution for each b in R^{n}
** A has n pivot positions
** A row equivalent to I_{n}
** The columns of A span R^{n}
** A^{t} is an invertible matrix
** The columns of A form a linearly independent set
** The linear transformation x -> Ax is one-one
** The linear transformation x -> Ax maps R^{n} to R^{n}
** A has a left inverse i.e. there exists a matrix C such that CA = I_{n}
** A has a right inverse i.e. there exists a matrix D such that DA = I_{n}
