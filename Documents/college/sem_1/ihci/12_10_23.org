* Automatic vs Conscious Emotions
- Emotions can be short-lived (eg: a fit of anger) or complex and long lasting (eg: jealousy)

- Our emotional state changes how we think
  * When frightened or angry, we focus narrowly and out bodies respond by tensing muscles and sweating
  * When happy, we are less focused and our bodies relax and we become more creative and we are more prone to overlook minor problems

* Desigining with the three leves in mind
1. =Visceral= Design refers to making products look, feel and sound good
2. =Behavioural= Design is about use, and it equates with traditional values of usability
3. =Reflective= Design is about considering the meaning and personal value of a product
